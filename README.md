Scalate Samples
===============

Scalate sample applications, including [scalate-sample](scalate-sample), a sample web application which contains
a number of example templates.

#### Usage:
Maven is required to build the sample applications. To run a sample application, from the application's directory
run the `mvn jetty:run` command, then open the sample homepage.

#### Note:
This plugin was separated from the main [scalate repository][1] in March 2015.
