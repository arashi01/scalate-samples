          | application/xhtml+xml

        li Better support for styling slides and printing them
        li
          | Requires additional style rules, so new script won't work with
          | old presentations without changes to their style sheets

          | old script!
    .slide
      h1 To use it off-line
      ul
        li
          | You can download
          a(shape="rect" href="slidy.zip") slidy.zip
          | and unzip it
          | to create a Slidy directory on your machine
        li
          | If you have cvs access to the W3C site you can check out the
          | Slidy directory
        li Remember to periodically check for updates
        li
          | You then have two choices:
          ol
            li
              | Use relative URIs depending on your local setup to access the
              | appropriate files. Use the same directory structure as on the W3C
              | server, ie, ".../2005/Talks/...".
            li
              | Run a Web server on your machine so that the directory above
              | can be accessed via
              code http://localhost/Talks/Tools/Slidy2
              | and use the URIs
              | of the form "/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/styles/slidy.css",
              | "/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/scripts/slidy.js".
        li
          | In both cases you can then publish your files on the W3C server
          | unchanged.

          | Internet Explorer on Windows XP now
          | disables scripting for web pages loaded directly from the local

      h1 Generate a Title Page
      p
        | If you want a separate title page with the W3C blue style, the

      pre(space="preserve")
        | <div class="slide cover">
        | <img src="http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/graphics/keys.jpg"

        a(shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/graphics/w3c-blue.css") w3c-blue.css
        | style sheet looks for the classes "slide" and "cover" on div and
        | img elements using the CSS selector
        em div.slide.cover
      p
        | This technique can be used to assign your slides to different
        | classes with a different appearence for each such class.
      p
        | Slidy also allows you to use different background markup for
        | different slides, based upon shared class names, as in "foo" below.
        | Backgrounds without additional class names are always shown except
        | when the slide isn't transparent. You may need to tweak your custom
        | style sheet.

      p

      ul.incremental
        li First bullet point

      .footnote
        p
          | An element is incrementally revealed if its parent element has
          | class="incremental" or if itself has that attribute. Text nodes are
          | not elements and are revealed when their parent element is
          | revealed. You can use class="incremental" on any element except for
          | <br />. Use class="non-incremental" to override the effect of
          | setting the parent element's class to incremental.
        p

          ul
            li
              | The Slidy script will then treat the list as an outline
              | list.
            li
              | Clicking on outline list items will expand/collapse block-level
              | elements within that list item.
            li Click on the above to make this list item collapse again.
        li
          | Users will then see expand/collapse icons as appropriate and
          | may click anywhere on the list item to change its state. This
          | particular list item can't be expanded or collapsed.
        li.expand
          | Add class="expand" to any li elements that you
          | want to start in an expanded state.
          ul

              | them.

          | div.vbox {
          | float: left;
          | height: 40%; width: 50%;
          | margin-top: -220px;
          | }
          | div.hbox {

      h1 Include SVG Content
      p
        | Inclusion of SVG content can be done using the object element,
        | for example:
      div(style="text-align: center;")
        object(width="50%" height="10%" title="Indian Office logo" type="image/svg+xml" data="graphics/example.svg")
          img(width="50%" alt="Indian Office logo" src="graphics/example.png")
      p has been achieved by:
      pre(space="preserve")
        | <object data="graphics/example.svg" type="image/svg+xml"
        | width="50%" height="10%" title="Indian Office logo">
        | <img src="graphics/example.png" width="50%"
        | alt="Indian Office logo" />
        | </object>
      p
        | This ensures that the enclosed png is displayed when the browser
        | has no plugin installed or can't display SVG directly. Providing
        | such a fall back is very important! Don't forget the alt text for
        | people who can't see the image.
      p However, there are caveats, see the next slide!
    .slide
      h1 Caveats with SVG+object
      p
        | Adobe has recently withdrawn support for its SVG Viewer, so you
        | are recommended to consider
        a(shape="rect" href="http://wiki.svg.org/Viewer_Implementations") alternatives
        | . If
        | you still using the Adobe SVG viewer you should be aware of bugs
        | when using the it with IE, Namely:
      ul
        li
          | Most modern browsers generally support SVG SVG Tiny 1.1 or
          | better natively without the need for a plugin
        li
          | If you need to use Internet Explorer you are advised to upgrade
          | to IE9 which includes native support for SVG.
        li
          | Patches to Internet Explorer mean that the Adobe SVG Viewer
          | version 3.03 no longer works with IE6. You are therefore
          | recommended to uninstall version 3.03 and instead install
          a(shape="rect" href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/beta.html")
            | Adobe SVG
            | Viewer 6.0 preview
          | if this is available to to you.
        li
          | IE6 makes a
          em copy
          | of the SVG file on the local disc
          | when displaying it; but doesn't pass the original URI to the
          | plugin
        li
          | As a result relative references from within the SVG to external
          | resources (scripts, CSS, images, other SVG) will break.
        li
          | The work around is to use absolute references within your
          | SVG.
        li
          | On Windows, the Adobe SVG plugin doesn't respect the CSS
          | z-index property, and if used on backgrounds will always show
          | through other content
    .slide
      h1 Additional Remarks
      ul
        li Slides are auto-numbered on the slide show footer
        li
          | You can link into the

              | ),
              br(clear="none")
              | e.g. slide 3 of this presentation is:
              a(shape="rect" href="#(3)") http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy#(3)
              ul
                li
                  | Previous versions of Slidy used square brackets, which will
                  | also work.
            li
              | Note that the browser's back/forward buttons may not work as
              | you might expect due to browser problems.
        li
          | Adding "title" to the list of classes for div elements that
          | serve as title pages will render the corresponding entry in the
          | table of contents in bold italic text (press "C" now for an
          | example)
        li
          | If your slides have more content than normal, use a
          em
            | meta
            | element
          | to request a smaller font
          ul
            li
              | the following requests fonts to be one step smaller than the
              | Slidy default for the current window width, and positive integers
              | will make the fonts correspondingly larger
          pre(space="preserve") <meta name="font-size-adjustment" content="-1" />
          ul
            li
              | Slidy uses JavaScript to dynamically set the font size on the
              | body element, but it is okay to specify relative font changes on
              | other elements within your own style sheet, e.g.
          pre(space="preserve") div.slide.large { font-size: 200% }
